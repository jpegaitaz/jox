Our mission is to position ETH Zurich as Europe’s leading institution in space research and education, while also being recognized as a premier partner for space-related projects within Switzerland and globally. Founded in 2022, ETH Zurich | Space has been under the leadership of Prof. Dr. Thomas Zurbuchen since 2023. We are committed to driving technological advancements, shaping future policies, and inspiring the next generation of space scientists and engineers.\nProject background\nAmong other activities, ETH Zurich | Space is building the “Project Hub” that supports ETH-led missions and technology programs. One of the missions that is actively supported is the LIFE Space Mission ( www.life-space-mission.com\n), which has been spearheaded by the Exoplanets & Habitability research group at ETH under the leadership of Prof. Dr. Sascha P. Quanz over the last years. The LIFE Space Mission addresses the most highly prioritized science objective in Space Exploration and Astrophysics and is attracting attention worldwide – finding life in a distant world. Also, LIFE is being developed at the time of paradigm changes in the space sector and the global economy – a time when it is possible to do science missions not just in the realms of traditional, large government agencies, but when new development schemes are making space mission implementation and access to space more common.\nLIFE has reached a critical point to advance the project to the next stage. After the formulation of an initial mission baseline description, mission requirements, and recent successes with the ETH-owned laboratory testbed, the completion of a full mission concept study is of highest priority. The mission concept study will finalize the required satellite architecture, conduct key technical trades, and finalize the overall mission development plan and implementation strategy to drive the LIFE Space Mission to successful launch and operations.\nJob description\nFor the LIFE Space Mission, you will take the role of overall Mission Architect and will be responsible for leading the concept study. You will closely interact with engineers and scientists involved in specific disciplines of the study. The goal is to formulate:\nAn end-to-end system overview for LIFE based on available technologies and development methodologies\nA breakdown of the overall LIFE development into major milestones and dedicated R&D missions that mature and test technology performance and retire risks for the final LIFE mission as imagined\nYou will further interact with colleagues from ETH Zurich | Space who have vast experience in the space industry and in the Swiss space ecosystem. Additional support from students and/or external partners is envisioned and needs to be established in coordination with the project leadership team.\nAs part of your role, you will:\nOversee the concept study for the LIFE Space Mission.\nHelp optimize the balance between scientific return, technology readiness, and mission feasibility while coordinating with the project manager to align schedule and cost.\nLead system-level trade studies, architecture definition, and subsystem interface design in collaboration with discipline engineers.\nEstablish additional support from students and external partners in coordination with the project leadership team.\nSupport the definition of system-level budgets (e.g., optical, mass, power, thermal).\nIdentify technical risks, propose mitigation strategies, and ensure traceability throughout the project lifecycle\nProvide technical guidance and mentoring to junior engineers and student teams involved in mission activities.\nWhile the main focus will be on the LIFE Space Mission, involvement in other projects (personal or within of ETH Zurich | Space) can be negotiated.\nProfile\nYou have a background in space mission engineering and architecture development for large-scale astrophysics missions. Experience working in an international setting and with industrial partners is a must.\nWe are looking for someone with:\nMaster’s degree or PhD in aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, or related fields.\n15+ years of experience in leading roles in large missions in concept and flight hardware development for NASA or ESA missions; involvement in the James Webb Space Telescope and/or exoplanet-driven missions is a plus.\nLeadership position in early formulation of (flagship) astrophysics missions is a must and experience at all phases of space telescope development (concept through commissioning) is a plus.\nProven record in the design and integration of space telescopes, (cryogenic) optical systems, and complex instrument subsystems.\nThe ability to conduct system-level analysis and trade studies to inform design decisions.\nIn-depth understanding of space mission requirements, space systems engineering principles, and lifecycle processes.\nStrong organizational and coordination skills to manage and balance project priorities, timelines, and resources.\nExcellent communication skills and a demonstrated ability to collaborate with international partners in academia and industry.\nWe offer\nA dynamic, international, and interdisciplinary work environment at one of the leading technical universities in the world.\nA motivated team of people sharing a passion for space and the vision to strengthen and enhance space research and activities at ETH Zurich.\nAn opportunity to help shape one of the most demanding science space missions during its early stages.\nWorking, teaching and research at ETH Zurich\nWe value diversity and sustainability\nIn line with our values\n, ETH Zurich encourages an inclusive culture. We promote equality of opportunity, value diversity and nurture a working and learning environment in which the rights and dignity of all our staff and students are respected. Visit our Equal Opportunities and Diversity website\nto find out how we ensure a fair and open environment that allows everyone to grow and flourish. Sustainability is a core value for us - we are consistently working towards a climate-neutral future\n.\nCurious? So are we.\nWe look forward to receiving your application with:\nA motivation letter (1-page max.)\nYour CV\nRelevant diplomas\nPlease note that we exclusively accept applications submitted through our online application portal. Applications via email or postal services will not be considered.\nFurther information can be found on our website\n.
